# Kickstarter

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects aunched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. Using Excel, this project aims to modify and analyze the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects as an attempt to uncover some of the market trends.

The conclusions drawn from the analysis and the limitiations of the study are presented in a word document in this repository.
